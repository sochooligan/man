NAME
     sshd - OpenSSH daemon

SYNOPSIS
     sshd [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     sshd (OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for ssh(1).  It provide secure encrypted commu-
     nications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

     sshd listens for connections from clients.  It is normally started at boot from /etc/rc.  It
     forks a new daemon for each incoming connection.  The forked daemons handle key exchange,
     encryption, authentication, command execution, and data exchange.
