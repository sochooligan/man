SSH-KEYSCAN(1)                        BSD General Commands Manual                        SSH-KEYSCAN(1)

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-keyscan [ ... ]
DESCRIPTION
     ssh-keyscan is a utility for gatheting the public SSH host keys of a number of hosts.  It
                                             SSH主机的 公用密钥
     was designed to aid in building and verifying ssh_known_hosts files, the format of which is
                            帮助构建  和  验证 ssh_known_hosts 文件
     documented in sshd(8).  ssh-keyscan provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell
     and perl scripts

     ssh-keyscan uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in parallel,
                      非阻塞 套接字I/O
     so it is very efficient.  The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of
     	      	   	        密钥
     seconds, even when some of those hosts are down or do not run sshd(8).  For scanning, one
                                                                             对于扫描,
     does not need login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning process

     If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using ssh-keyscan without verifying the keys,
                                                                 不验证 密钥
     users will be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.  On the other hand, if the security
                易受攻击的         处于中间的人       的攻击
     model allows such a risk, ssh-keyscan can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man

     in the middle attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was created.

FILES
     /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

EXAMPLES
     Print host keys for machine hostname:
	   $ ssh-keyscan github.com

     Print the RSA host key for machine hostname:
	   $ ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com
